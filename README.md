## Updating course files

Of course, you are most welcome to use git like you normally would, but not everyone is familiar with it.  In the interest of making things simpler, you can update this repo in your Cloud Shell by running the following commands--in your Cloud Shell, of course:

```bash
cd ~/gcp-cloud-engineer/
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
```

Please feel free to read through this update script before you run it.


## Following along with commands

Some of the commands we run in the labs can be a bit long and finicky.  To help you not trip on the typing, many of the commands are available in supporting files in this repo.  Since the whole point of doing the course is to learn, though, try to understand what the command actually does.  Do not just copy-paste it and move on.
